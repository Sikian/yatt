# Yet Another Typescript Template

This project is meant to be used as a template. 

## Getting started

- Clone this project
- Change your remote `git remote set-url origin <new-origin>`
- Adjust the `package.json` with the correct name, description, etc.
- Make sure `tsconfig.json` matches your requirements (i.e target, lib, etc.)
- Get cracking :muscle:
